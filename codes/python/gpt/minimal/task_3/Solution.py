To tackle the ambulance dispatching problem, we need to implement a solution that efficiently assigns ambulances to emergencies, taking into account various factors such as travel times, ambulance capabilities, and hospital capacities. We will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the optimal routes and selection criteria for both ambulances and hospitals.

Here is a Python implementation based on the requirements:

```python
import json
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

def calculate_travel_time(distance, base_speed, congestion_factor):
    if congestion_factor == 0:  # Handle potential division by zero
        return float('inf')
    return distance / (base_speed * congestion_factor) * 60

def dijkstra(graph, start_node):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start_node] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start_node)]
    
    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
        
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node]:
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))
    
    return distances

def construct_graph(regions):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for region in regions:
        region_id = region['region_id']
        base_speed = region['speed']
        congestion_factor = region['congestion_factor']
        blocked_routes = set(region['blocked_routes'])
        
        for neighbor, distance in region['distances'].items():
            if neighbor in blocked_routes:
                continue
            travel_time = calculate_travel_time(distance, base_speed, congestion_factor)
            graph[region_id].append((neighbor, travel_time))
    
    return graph

def dispatch_ambulance(emergency_event, ambulances, hospitals, regions):
    emergency_id = emergency_event['id']
    emergency_region = emergency_event['region_id']
    emergency_severity = emergency_event['severity']
    emergency_type = emergency_event['type']
    special_requirements = emergency_event['special_requirements']
    
    # Step 1: Select the fastest ambulance
    region_graph = construct_graph(regions)
    distances_from_emergency = dijkstra(region_graph, emergency_region)
    
    suitable_ambulances = [
        amb for amb in ambulances
        if amb['status'] == 'Available' and
           (emergency_severity != 'Critical' or 'Advanced Life Support' in amb['capabilities'])
    ]
    
    if not suitable_ambulances:
        return {"emergency_id": emergency_id, "assigned_ambulance": None, "destination_hospital": None}
    
    suitable_ambulances.sort(key=lambda amb: (
        distances_from_emergency.get(amb['current_region'], float('inf')),
        'Advanced Life Support' in amb['capabilities'],
        amb['id']
    ))
    
    selected_ambulance = suitable_ambulances[0]
    
    # Step 2: Choose the best hospital
    distances_from_ambulance = dijkstra(region_graph, selected_ambulance['current_region'])
    
    suitable_hospitals = [
        hos for hos in hospitals
        if emergency_severity != 'Critical' or 
           emergency_type in hos['capabilities']
    ]
    
    if not suitable_hospitals:
        return {"emergency_id": emergency_id, "assigned_ambulance": selected_ambulance['id'], "destination_hospital": None}
    
    suitable_hospitals.sort(key=lambda hos: (
        distances_from_ambulance.get(hos['region_id'], float('inf')),
        hos['emergency_capacity'] == 'High',
        hos['emergency_capacity'] == 'Medium',
        hos['id']
    ))
    
    selected_hospital = suitable_hospitals[0]
    
    return {
        "emergency_id": emergency_id,
        "assigned_ambulance": selected_ambulance['id'],
        "destination_hospital": selected_hospital['id']
    }

def main():
    import sys
    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
    result = dispatch_ambulance(
        input_data['emergency_event'],
        input_data['ambulances'],
        input_data['hospitals'],
        input_data['regions']
    )
    print(json.dumps(result))

    main()

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Construction**: We construct a graph where each region is a node and the edges are the travel times between regions, calculated using the provided formula and taking into account congestion factors.

2. **Ambulance Selection**: Using Dijkstra's algorithm, we find the fastest available ambulance that meets the capability requirements for the emergency. We sort and select based on travel time, capability, and ID.

3. **Hospital Selection**: Similarly, we use Dijkstra's algorithm to choose a hospital that matches the emergency type and urgency. We prioritize based on travel time and emergency capacity.

4. **Error Handling**: If no suitable ambulance or hospital is found, the function returns a structured response with `None` where applicable.

This approach ensures the efficient assignment of ambulances and hospitals for emergency events while adhering to all given constraints.
