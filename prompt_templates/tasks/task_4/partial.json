  "description": "Implement a medical resource allocation system for emergency triage that optimizes the number of patients saved by correctly prioritizing limited medical resources based on patient survival probability curves.",
  "implementation_requirements": [
    "1. Input/Output Requirements:",
    "   a. Input Format:",
    "      - patients: Array of arrays, where each inner array contains the survival probability curve for a patient",
    "      - resources: Array of objects, each containing a 'time' (time required to apply) and 'boost' (probability increase)",
    "      - responders: Number of available responders (each can apply one resource at a time)",
    "      - total_time: Maximum time available for all treatments",
    "   b. Output Format:",
    "      - Return a complete object with the following properties:",
    "        * assignments: Array of objects, each specifying a treatment {patient, resource, time}",
    "        * survivors: Number of patients with final probability > 50%",
    "        * total_survival_probability: Sum of all patients' final probabilities",
    "   c. Constraints:",
    "      - Do NOT modify the input data structures",
    "      - When no assignment is possible, return assignments as empty array but maintain object structure",
    "      - Follow the exact output format shown in the examples",
    
    "2. Algorithm Implementation (Resource Optimization):",
    "   a. Problem Definition:",
    "      - Each patient has a survival probability curve that decreases over time",
    "      - Patient arrays represent survival probabilities at each minute (index 0 = minute 0, index 1 = minute 1, etc.)",
    "      - Each medical resource takes time to apply and boosts survival probability",
    "      - Responders can only apply one resource at a time (one responder can only treat one patient at any given time)",
    "      - The goal is to maximize total survivors within the time constraint",
    
    "   b. Core Algorithm Steps:",
    "      - Step 1: Calculate each patient's survival probability at each possible treatment time",
    "        * Apply resource boost to the base probability and calculate final probability",
    "        * Account for probability decay while waiting for treatment",
    "      - Step 2: Implement a priority-based scheduling algorithm",
    "        * Use dynamic programming to find optimal resource-patient assignments",
    "        * Track responder availability over time (a responder becomes available after completing a treatment)",
    "        * Consider all possible resource combinations for each patient",
    "      - Step 3: Resolve conflicting resource demands",
    "        * A conflict occurs when multiple optimal treatments require the same responder at the same time",
    "        * Prioritize treatments that maximize total survival probability",
    "        * Consider sequential treatments for critical patients",
    
    "   c. Calculation Rules:",
    "      - Individual Patient Probability Calculation:",
    "        * When a resource is applied at time t, the starting probability is the patient's probability at time t",
    "        * The resource's boost value is then added to this starting probability",
    "        * A patient's final probability after treatment(s) cannot exceed 100%",
    "        * If a patient receives multiple treatments, each subsequent treatment uses the probability after the previous treatment",
    "        * A patient is considered a survivor if their final probability > 50%",
    "      - Total Survival Probability Calculation:",
    "        * The total survival probability is the sum of all patients' final probabilities after all treatments",
    "        * This total may exceed 100% as it represents the combined probability across multiple patients",
    "        * This is an aggregate measure used to compare different allocation strategies"
