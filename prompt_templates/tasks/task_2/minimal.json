        "   a. Do NOT modify the input data structures",
        "   b. Always return a complete object with the five fields (patient_id, assigned_hospital, assigned_ward, assigned_bed, reallocated_patients)",
        "   c. When no assignment is possible, return fields as null but maintain the object structure",
        "   d. The reallocated_patients array should only include patient_id, new_hospital, new_ward, and new_bed fields",

        "      - Find all matching wards by checking gender restrictions, age limits, and special requirements",
        "      - Check for available beds in matching wards",
        "      - If a bed is available, assign it immediately and return the result",

        "      - For each potential transferable patient, verify if they can be moved to ANY lower-level hospital",
        "      - The transferred patient must meet ALL requirements of the new ward (gender, age, special requirements)",
        "      - When a valid transfer is found: (1) Assign the high-risk patient to the exact bed number of the transferable patient, (2) Move the existing patient to the lowest numbered available bed in their new ward",
