        "1. Input/Output Requirements:",
        "   a. Do NOT modify the input data structures",
        "   b. Always return a complete object with the five fields (patient_id, assigned_hospital, assigned_ward, assigned_bed, reallocated_patients)",
        "   c. When no assignment is possible, return fields as null but maintain the object structure",
        "   d. The reallocated_patients array should only include patient_id, new_hospital, new_ward, and new_bed fields",
        "   e. Follow the exact output format shown in the examples",
        
        "2. Algorithm:",
        "   a. Patient Evaluation:",
        "      - First determine if the patient is high-risk (is_post_surgery = true)",
        "      - For high-risk patients, ONLY Model 4 hospitals should be considered",
        "      - For non-high-risk patients, lower model hospitals (Models 1-3) should be prioritized over Model 4 hospitals",
        "   b. Direct Assignment (First Attempt):",
        "      - Find all matching wards by checking gender restrictions, age limits, and special requirements",
        "      - Check for available beds in matching wards",
        "      - If a bed is available, assign it immediately and return the result",
        "      - Process beds in ascending numerical order (e.g., bed 1 before bed 2)",
        "   c. Reallocation (Second Attempt - only for high-risk patients):",
        "      - If no beds are directly available for a high-risk patient, examine EACH BED in Model 4 hospitals",
        "      - Check every occupied bed, focusing on patients with days_in_hospital > 3 and non_transferable = false",
        "      - Process beds in ascending numerical order within each ward (bed 3 before bed 5)",
        "      - For each potential transferable patient, verify if they can be moved to ANY lower-level hospital",
        "      - The transferred patient must meet ALL requirements of the new ward (gender, age, special requirements)",
        "      - When a valid transfer is found: (1) Assign the high-risk patient to the exact bed number of the transferable patient, (2) Move the existing patient to the lowest numbered available bed in their new ward",
        "      - Record only patient_id, new_hospital, new_ward, and new_bed in the reallocated_patients array",
        "   d. No Assignment (Final Case):",

        "      - High-risk patients must be assigned ONLY to Model 4 hospitals",
        "      - Non-high-risk patients should be assigned preferentially to lower-level hospitals (Models 1-3) before Model 4",
        "      - If multiple suitable hospitals exist, process them in the order they appear in the input array",
        "   b. Patient Transfer Constraints:",
        "      - Only patients with days_in_hospital > 3 can be considered for reallocation",
        "      - Patients marked as non_transferable = true must never be reallocated",
        "      - Reallocated patients must match all requirements of their new ward, including gender restrictions, age limits, and all special requirements",
        "      - When a patient has special requirements, they can only be transferred to wards that can fulfill these requirements",
        "   c. Ward Matching Constraints:",
        "      - Patients must match the gender_restriction of the ward (or ward has 'No Restriction')",
        "      - Female patients can be assigned to 'Female Only' or 'No Restriction' wards",
        "      - Male patients can be assigned to 'Male Only' or 'No Restriction' wards",
        "      - Patient's age must be within the ward's age_restriction range [min, max]",
        "      - ALL special_requirements of the patient must be provided by the ward",
        
        "4. Special Rules and Edge Cases:",
        "   a. Multiple Candidate Handling:",
        "      - When multiple patients are candidates for reallocation, prioritize by days_in_hospital (highest first)",
        "      - If days_in_hospital values are equal, prioritize by bed number (lowest first)",
        "      - When multiple hospitals/wards are suitable, process them in the order they appear in the input array",
        "   b. Empty Data Handling:",
        "      - If a patient has no special_requirements, treat it as an empty array []",
        "      - A ward with no available_beds should be skipped for direct assignment",
        "   c. Specific Test Scenarios:",
        "      - When transferable patients exist but have special requirements that lower-level hospitals cannot fulfill, return null assignments (test case 10)",
        "      - If no ward can fulfill the patient's special requirements, return null assignments (test case 5)",
        "      - If patient's age is outside all wards' restrictions, return null assignments (test case 6)",
        "      - Gender restrictions must be strictly enforced when transferring patients to new wards (test cases 7, 8, 9)",
        "   d. Bed Selection Rules:",
        "      - For direct assignments, always select the lowest numbered available bed",
        "      - For reallocation scenarios, preserve the exact bed number of the transferred patient for the high-risk patient",
        "      - For example, if a transferable patient is in bed 3, the high-risk patient must be assigned specifically to bed 3",
        "   e. Data Integrity:",
        "      - Do not modify the original patient or hospital data structures",
        "      - Include only the required fields in reallocated_patients: patient_id, new_hospital, new_ward, and new_bed"
